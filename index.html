            <h2>Man of Peace Nanhe</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Lal Bahadur Shastri</strong> was born on the 2nd of
              October in 1904 in Mughalsarai of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. His
              father was Sharada Prasad Shrivastava and his mother was named
              Ramdulari Devi. Lal Bahadur Shastri was a student in the East
              Central Railway Inter College in Mughalsarai and Varanasi. In
              1926, he successfully completed his graduation from the Kashi
              Vidyapeeth. As a part of his Graduation degree award, he was given
              the title of “Shastri" which loosely translates to “Scholar” in
              English. Somehow this degree began to be used as a part of his
              name. From a very young Life, Lal Bahadur Shastri was inspired by
              the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. Following the footsteps of his idol,
              he wanted to work to uplift the weak and poor in society. He thus
              became a Life member of the Servants of the People Society also
              known as the Lok Sevak Mandal which was established by Lala Lajpat
              Rai.
